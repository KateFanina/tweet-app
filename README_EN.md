This Git repository contains a project based on technologies React, React
Router, React Lazy, React Hook, Axios, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI and Styled
components. This is a tweets app that allows you to user to follow other users
and follow their updates.

A user is subscribed only after a tweet has been successfully updated, ie the
button changes to following only after the data on the card has increased Users
can use a filter to display all tweets, only those to which he is subscribed, or
only those to which he is not subscribed.

However, the most notable feature of this app this improved pagination. Instead
of a standard button "Load more", the application uses more functional
pagination that requests to the server every time the user moves by pages. This
is done to increase application performance, which allows significant speed up
the loading of tweets. There is also a convenient page navigation for
convenience. user. The application code is written using the Redux Toolkit,
which allows you to reduce the amount of code and make it's more readable and
maintainable.

Also, using React Router and React Lazy makes it easy to create and maintain
routes and lazy loading of application components, which improves application
performance.

To run the project locally, you must have a version Node 18.12.1. After cloning
the repository, you need to enter the command "npm install" to install all
necessary dependencies, and "npm run start" to start the application.
